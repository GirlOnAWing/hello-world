# hello-world
hey what's up hello
I'm Kristina. I'm a Human Computer Interaction student at DePaul University. I love design and language. So far I've only dabbled in HTML, CSS5, JavaScript, French and Korean. I've really enjoyed learning about front end development so far and am excited to see where this journey takes me. Oh, and I also love my Alaskan Malamute pup, Kali, even though she broke my leg.
